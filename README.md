# plex-music-rating-sync

Plex Agents do not read music ratings from files during import, nor do they write ratings or playlists back to disk.
This makes sense server-side — every Plex user should be able to maintain their own ratings and playlists independently.

This project began as a way to bridge that gap: a simple sync tool to push track ratings and playlists into a specific Plex user account and server,
preserving personal curation from MediaMonkey.

Over time, it has evolved. What started as a one-way bridge has grown into a powerful any-to-any sync engine
between Plex, MediaMonkey, and filesystem-based libraries. Ratings and playlists can now be transferred in either direction.

## Features

- synchronize: track ratings, playlists (not automatically generated)
- supported local media players: [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) and local file system
- dry run without applying any changes
- automatically or manually resolve conflicting track ratings
- logging

## FileSystem Player Support

This application now supports using a local file system directory as a media player source or destination. This allows you to:

- Sync ratings between media files on disk and Plex/MediaMonkey
- Create and manage playlists using standard M3U format
- Read/write ratings directly to media file metadata

## Requirements

- Windows
- [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) v4.x. v5.0 and above don't work, see [#23](https://github.com/patzm/plex-music-rating-sync/issues/23#issuecomment-894646791).
- _Plex Media Server_ (PMS)
- Python 3.12 or higher with packages:
  - [PlexAPI v4.2.0](https://pypi.org/project/PlexAPI/)
  - [pypiwin32](https://pypi.org/project/pypiwin32/): to use the COM interface
  - [fuzzywuzzy](https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy): for fuzzy string matching
  - [python-Levenshtein](https://github.com/miohtama/python-Levenshtein) (optional): to improve performance of `fuzzywuzzy`
  - [numpy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
  - [ConfigArgParse](https://pypi.org/project/ConfigArgParse/)
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
  - [mutagen](https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Start the synchronization:
`./sync_ratings.py --server <server_name> --username <my@email.com|user_name>`
Using the `--dry` flag in combination with `--log DEBUG` is recommended to see what changes will be made.

## Cache Modes

The sync tool supports different caching strategies to optimize performance:

| Mode         | Caches Metadata | Caches Matches | Persists Between Runs |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| metadata     | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No          | ❌ No                 |
| matches      | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes                |
| matches-only | ❌ No           | ✅ Yes         | ✅ Yes                |
| disabled     | ❌ No           | ❌ No          | ❌ No                 |

- **metadata**: Caches track metadata in memory for faster lookups during sync
- **matches**: Caches both metadata and track matches, saves matches between runs
- **matches-only**: Only caches track matches persistently, no metadata caching
- **disabled**: No caching, all operations performed directly

Cache files are stored in the application directory and can be cleared using `--clear-cache`.

### Advanced Tag Configuration (Optional)

**Note**
For most users, you don't need to configure anything about tag formats or rating strategies manually. The tool will:

- Detect which tags are used in your files
- Infer the most appropriate rating scales
- Prompt you for resolution strategy only if conflicting ratings are found
- Optionally write to `config.ini` after the first run, if necessary.

- **`tag_write_strategy`**: _Determines how rating tags are written to files._

  - _`write_all`_: Write to all known and configured tags.
  - _`write_default`_: Only write to the `default_tag`; do not remove other tags.
  - _`overwrite_default`_: Write only to the `default_tag` and delete all other rating tags.

- **`default_tag`**: _The canonical tag to use for writing when applicable._

  - _Options_: Player values such as `MEDIAMONKEY`, `WINDOWSMEDIAPLAYER`, `MUSICBEE`, `WINAMP`, `TEXT`.
  - _Unknown/custom tags (e.g., `POPM:foobar@example.com`) are also allowed._

- **`conflict_resolution_strategy`**: _Determines how to resolve conflicting rating values across tags._

  - _`prioritized_order`_: Use the tag with the highest priority in the list below.
  - _`highest`_: Use the highest numeric rating found.
  - _`lowest`_: Use the lowest numeric rating found.
  - _`average`_: Use the average of all numeric ratings.
  - _`choice`_: Prompt user to manually enter a rating.

- **`tag_priority_order`**: _Ordered list of tag identifiers used for resolving conflicts._
  - _Recognized values_: Player values such as `MEDIAMONKEY`, `WINDOWSMEDIAPLAYER`, `MUSICBEE`, `WINAMP`, `TEXT`.
  - _Unknown/custom tags (e.g., `POPM:foobar@example.com`) are also allowed._

## Current issues

- the [PlexAPI](https://pypi.org/project/PlexAPI/) seems to be only working for the administrator of the PMS.

## Potential next features

With the current state I have completed all functionality I desired to have.
Consequently I will _not_ continue development unless you request it.
I welcome anyone to join the development of this little cmd-line tool.
Just open a [new issue](https://github.com/patzm/plex-music-rating-sync/issues/new), post a pull request, or ask me to give you permissions for the repository itself.

These are a few ideas I have for features that would make sense:

- setup routine
- parallelization
- better user-interaction with nicer dialogs
- iTunes synchronization?
